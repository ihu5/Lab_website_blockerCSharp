# Lab_website_blocker
Author: (@journey6) Hussain

GUI application written in C# to block websites that can be used in school Labs to prevent students from getting busy with such websites like watching videos on Youtube ... etc

It works on both Windows 7 and 10 ( on Windows 10 it may ask you to accept downloading .Net framework 3.5 )
